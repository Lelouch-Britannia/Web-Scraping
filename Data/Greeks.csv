"a genetic study by clemente et al  found that in the early bronze age the populations of the minoan helladic and cycladic civilizations in the aegean were genetically homogeneous in contrast the aegean population during the middle bronze age was more differentiated probably due to gene flow from a yamnaya related population from the ponticcaspian steppe this is corroborated by sequenced genomes of middle bronze age individuals from northern greece who had a much higher proportion of steppe related ancestry the timing of this gene flow was estimated at  bce and is consistent with the dominant linguistic theories explaining the emergence of the proto greek language present day greeks share  of their ancestry with them suggesting continuity between the two time periods in the case of mycenaean greeks however this steppe related ancestry was diluted the ancestry of the mycenaeans could be explained via a  way admixture model of such mba individuals in northern greece and either an eba aegean or mba minoan population the difference between the two time periods could be explained by the general decline of the mycenaean civilization
