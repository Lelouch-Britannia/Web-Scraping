"geoffrey sampson stated that egyptian hieroglyphs came into existence a little after sumerian script and probably were invented under the influence of the latter and that it is probable that the general idea of expressing words of a language in writing was brought to egypt from sumerian mesopotamia there are many instances of early egypt mesopotamia relations but given the lack of direct evidence for the transfer of writing no definitive determination has been made as to the origin of hieroglyphics in ancient egypt others have held that the evidence for such direct influence remains flimsy and that a very credible argument can also be made for the independent development of writing in egypt
