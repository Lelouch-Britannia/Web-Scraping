Though in many natural objects  whiteness refiningly enhances beauty  as if imparting some special virtue of its own  as in marbles  japonicas  and pearls  and though various nations have in some way recognised a certain royal preeminence in this hue  even the barbaric  grand old kings of Pegu placing the title  Lord of the White Elephants  above all their other magniloquent ascriptions of dominion  and the modern kings of Siam unfurling the same snow   white quadruped in the royal standard  and the Hanoverian flag bearing the one figure of a snow   white charger  and the great Austrian Empire  Caesarian  heir to overlording Rome  having for the imperial colour the same imperial hue  and though this pre   eminence in it applies to the human race itself  giving the white man ideal

mortal sympathies and symbolizings  this same hue is made the emblem of many touching  noble things    the innocence of brides  the benignity of age  though among the Red Men of America the giving of the white belt of wampum was the deepest pledge of honour  though in many climes  whiteness typifies the majesty of Justice in the ermine of the Judge  and contributes to the daily state of kings and queens drawn by milk   white steeds  though even in the higher mysteries of the most august religions it has been made the symbol of the divine spotlessness and power  by the Persian fire worshippers  the white forked flame being held the holiest on the altar  and in the Greek mythologies  Great Jove himself being made incarnate in a snow   white bull  and though to the noble Iroquois  the midwinter sacrifice of the sacred White Dog was by far the holiest festival of their theology  that spotless  faithful creature being held the purest envoy they could send to the Great Spirit with the annual tidings of their own fidelity  and though directly from the Latin word for white  all Christian priests derive the name of one part of their sacred vesture  the alb or tunic  worn beneath the

Again  it is very often observed that  if the sperm whale  once struck  is allowed time to rally  he then acts  not so often with blind rage  as with wilful  deliberate designs of destruction to his pursuers  nor is it without conveying some eloquent indication of his character  that upon being attacked he will frequently open his mouth  and retain it in that dread expansion for several consecutive minutes ,observed sperm whale struck allowed time rally acts blind rage wilful deliberate designs destruction pursuers conveying eloquent indication character attacked frequently open mouth retain dread expansion consecutive minutes,10.00,"observed,sperm,whale,struck,allowed,time,rally,acts,blind,rage,wilful,deliberate,designs,destruction,pursuers,conveying,eloquent,indication,character,attacked,frequently,open,mouth,retain,dread,expansion,consecutive,minutes",0.00,
