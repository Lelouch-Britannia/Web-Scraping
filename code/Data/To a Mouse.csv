"little cunning cowering timorous beast
oh what a panic is in your breast
you need not start away so hasty
with bickering prattle
i would be loath to run and chase you
with murdering paddle

i am truly sorry mans dominion
has broken natures social union
and justifies that ill opinion
which makes you startle
at me your poor earth born companion
and fellow mortal

i doubt not sometimes that you may thieve
what then poor beast you must live
an odd ear in twenty four sheaves
is a small request
i will get a blessing with what is left
and never miss it

your small house too in ruin
its feeble walls the winds are scattering
and nothing now to build a new one
of coarse green foliage
and bleak decembers winds ensuing
both bitter and piercing

you saw the fields laid bare and empty
and weary winter coming fast
and cozy here beneath the blast
you thought to dwell
till crash the cruel coulter passed
out through your cell

that small heap of leaves and stubble
has cost you many a weary nibble
now you are turned out for all your trouble
without house or holding
to endure the winters sleety dribble
and hoar frost cold

but mouse you are not alone
in proving foresight may be vain
the best laid schemes of mice and men
go oft awry
and leave us nothing but grief and pain
for promised joy

still you are blessed compared with me
the present only touches you
but oh i backward cast my eye
on prospects dreary
and forward though i cannot see
i guess and fearcitation needed
